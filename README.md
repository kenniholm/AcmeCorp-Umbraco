Welcome to my project! <br>
This was created for Umbraco as a homework assignment for their internship program. <br>
<br>

For launching the project itself i recommend using visual studio, simply run it with ISS Express by clicking the button which is highlighted on the picture. <br>
Make sure it is "AcmeCorporation" which is selected in the downdown menu next to the ISS Express button. <br>
<br>
Information about the project: <br>
The web application will automaticly seed the db if there is no valid serials in the database
and print them to a text document located in the root of the "AcmeCorporation" folder. This file is called "ProductSerials" it can be
opened with any text editor. <br>
These can be used to enter the draw. If any of them wont work it is most likely because they were used for the first 11 entries.
The 11 entries for the draw in the db, is there to show off the pagination on the submissions page.<br>
