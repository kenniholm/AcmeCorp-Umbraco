**Welcome to my project!** <br>
This was created for Umbraco as a homework assignment for their internship program. <br>
<br>
**Getting started:** <br>
Be sure to atleast have .Net Core 3.0 installed before running the project. <br>
.Net Core 3.0 can be found here: <br>
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1 <br>
Please use any of the supported browsers in the picture for the application to work as intended: <br>

<br>
**Launching the site:** <br>
For launching the project itself i recommend using visual studio, simply double click the solution and run it with ISS Express by clicking the button which is highlighted on the picture. <br>
Make sure it is "AcmeCorporation" which is selected in the dropdown menu next to the ISS Express button. <br>

<br>
**Information about the project:** <br>
The web application will automaticly seed the db if there is no valid serials in the database
and print them to a text document located in the root of the "AcmeCorporation" folder. This file is called "ProductSerials" it can be
opened with any text editor. <br>
These can be used to enter the draw. If any of them wont work it is most likely because they were used for the first 11 entries, just try another and it should work fine.
The 11 were added to show the functionality of the pagination on the submissions page.<br>
<br>
