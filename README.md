Information about the project:
The web application will automaticly seed the db if there is no valid serials in the database
and print them to a text document located in the root of "AcmeCorporation" folder called "ProductSerials" this file can be
opened with any text editor. These can be used to enter the draw. If any of them wont work it is most likely because they were used for the first 11 entries.
The 11 entries for the draw in the db, is there to show off the pagination on the submissions page.
